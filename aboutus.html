    <h2> about my profession </h2>
    <p>
        A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        allow users to access and interact with the site or app.Frontend development denotes the realm of web development that concentrates on what the users see on their end. It revolves around changing the code created by backend developers into a graphical
        interface, making sure that the data is delivered in a simple, easy-to-read format. Without frontend development, all one can see on a website or web application would be some undecipherable codes. Because of frontend developers, people having
        no background in coding can readily understand and utilize web applications and websites. The thing you see when you visit Canva, Facebook, Google Apps, and other web applications are products of both frontend and backend developers working together.
